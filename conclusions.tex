\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis effectively demonstrated that building an unbiased search engine using Golang, TF-IDF ranking, and pattern matching is not only feasible but can potentially outperform traditional advertisement-driven search engines in delivering relevant results. Goseek as a command-line tool successfully delivered on its promise of being a lightweight and fast search engine utilizing higher order algorithms.
The integration of bitonic sort proved its superiority to quicksort, showing an improvement in speed by 76 times while maintaining lower memory usage. The pattern matching implementation using the KMP algorithm demonstrated blazingly fast performance and efficiency, processing 100,000 documents in just 1.2 seconds. Perhaps most importantly, the engine maintained consistent performance without compromising accuracy or introducing advertising bias, which was one of the primary motivations for the project.
Looking forward, while Goseek currently exists as a command-line tool with certain limitations, such as its pre-processing of \textbf{.html} documents, despite this, it has established a solid foundation for future development.Its Architecture is robust and easily extandable to any number of file extensions this gives options to other developers to extend its functionality. While there's room for further optimization and feature enhancement,
GoSeek represents a meaningful step toward more transparent and efficient information retrieval systems.
