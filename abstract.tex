Modern data mangement and search systems hardly yield accurate results while searching due to the their nature to always trade off precision
for monetization purposes. Present solutions such as Google and Bing frequently overlook the needed balance between performance and unbiased 
delivery of results in both text matching and text searching. This thesis discusses a novel framework written in Golang, to defeat these constraints 
by using combinations of algorithms. The system uses statistical term weighting methodologies in conjuction with pattern matching techniques
that guarantee accuracy of the results with no ranking bias.Performance testing on large document collections showed extraordinary efficiency
improvments - parallel sorting mechanisms were 76 times faster compared to traditional methdods mainting minimum resource usage. The pattern
detection showed very high throughput, processing large document sets in less than a second.The research here confirms that using eliminating 
ranking bias and using robust algorithms results in faster and more accurate search system. Although at present It's functionality is limited
to the command line, the architecture has been designed modularly to support further scaling.This work forms a critical contribution 
toward the the creation of open source and efficient content discovery systems.
